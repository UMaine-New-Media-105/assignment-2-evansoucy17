I created code that created a combination of two country flags, Ethopia and Switzerland. I was able to create this by combining two functions which
allowed me to create three copies of a rectangle only changing postion and color to create the background. I then created another function to make 
the white cross. I came into a slight issue when the translation used on the background rectangles was being applied to the cross. So I added the 
push and pop to my backgorundRect function. The only thing I had to do was fix one of the Y variables and everything was all set.
